Hello! AccountMe App is an accountability app that allows users to add and remove tasks to 
improve their productivity. The app allows users to track their tasks by setting deadlines and 
when completed, users can remove the tasks that were completed. 

The tech stacks used for this project includes, React, HTML, SASS, Node JS, Axios, and REST API.

To start the app, npm install in both the front-end and back-end files.
After the installment, start back-end application by node index.js 
and npm start in front-end application.

Some of the difficulties I found during this project is to connect the back-end to front-end application.
In the future, I would like to implement log in and log out function to the app to allow users  to have personalized tasks and allow users to 
add friends and message each other. In addition, I would like to implement database to the project using SQL to improve scaleability of the app.
